# Practice ML-AI

## Description
This repository contains practice notebooks in **Machine Learning (ML), Deep Learning (DL), and Artificial Intelligence (AI)** using datasets and reference code from Kaggle.  
The main goal is to **learn and understand AI concepts** through hands-on practice.

## Dataset
- Datasets are sourced from **Kaggle** and uploaded directly to this repository for **educational purposes**.  
- All datasets are used solely for learning and experimentation.

## Notebooks
- Notebooks may include code taken from Kaggle as reference.  
- As understanding improves, notebooks will be gradually modified or created **from scratch**.

## Purpose
- Practice reading, understanding, and modifying ML/DL/AI code.  
- Experiment with models, neural networks, hyperparameter tuning, visualization, and evaluation.  
- Track and document learning progress on GitHub for personal and educational use.
